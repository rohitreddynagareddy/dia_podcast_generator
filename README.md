**Welcome To GOATBookLM The Open Source Podcast Generator Powered by Nari Labs Dia 1B**

The Colab notebook in this repo enables you to generate **dual voice** podcast style audio files using Nari labs open source audio model Dia-1.B. 

Link to the notebook in Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/smartaces/dia_podcast_generator/blob/main/GOATBookLM_Nari_Labs_DIA_1B_Open_Source_Podcast_Generator_Shared.ipynb

It is structured as follows...

1.   First an example of generating a basic short clip with Dia-1.6B using the default randomized voices functionality.

2.   After that, the notebook allows you choose and load base voices which will allow you to create longer podcast style audio files ENSURING CONSISTENT voices throughout.

Beyond this, the notebook also includes:

*   A Dia formatted podcast script generator from any text source you copy paste in. This makes it super simple to quickly create a script which is optimized for how Dia works giving the best possible output. You also of course have the option to modify the script as you wish.

*   The script generator allows you to use a variety of OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic models.

*   The notebook also allows you preview sections of the podcast audio you generate, and redraft/ regenerate parts if needed.

*   Finally the notebook exports a complete single file which you can listen to as a full podcast recording.
